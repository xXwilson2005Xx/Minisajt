         He streaked through the sport like a comet, an other-worldly superstar whose brilliance as a driver was matched by a dazzling intellect and coruscating charisma that illuminated Formula One racing as never before. 
         No one tried harder or pushed himself further, nor did anyone shed so much light on the extremes to which only the greatest drivers go. Intensely introspective and passionate in the extreme, Ayrton Senna endlessly sought to extend his limits, 
         to go faster than himself, a quest that ultimately made him a martyr but did not diminish his mystique.

         The 30th Formula 1 World Champion was the youngest ever, taking his first title in the most dramatic fashion, on the last corner of the last lap of the last race of one of the most scintillating seasons. 
         The sensational triumph of the sport's first black driver, in only his second year at the pinnacle of motorsport, was a welcome human interest story that focused unprecedented international attention on Formula 1 racing. 
         His prodigious talent and pleasing personality made Lewis Hamilton an inspirational role model and ideal ambassador for his profession.

         Since the Formula One World Drivers' Championship began in 1950 the title has been won by 32 different drivers, 15 of whom won more than one championship. 
         Of the multiple champions the most prolific was Juan Manuel Fangio, whose record of five titles stood for five decades until it was eclipsed by the most successful driver in the sport's history. 
         Seven times a champion, Michael Schumacher also holds nearly every scoring record in the book by a considerable margin. Though his ethics were sometimes questioned, as was his decision to make a comeback after retiring, his sheer dominance when in his prime is beyond doubt.
